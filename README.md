# Machine Learning Final Project: ANFIS classifier for market behavior prediction
Final Project for the Machine Learning Course, proposed by Euklid Ltd.

This directory is self-sufficient and includes everything needed to perform feature engineering, training, and evaluations. It contains:
- A notebook `anfis.ipynb` where the actual feature engineering, training, and evaluations are performed.
- Preprocessed stocks and indices prices datasets, ending with `_ok.csv`.
- A `utilities.py` file with custom calculations and plotting functions, written mainly to de-clutter the notebook.
- The modified ANFIS modules `anfis.py`, `membership.py`, `experimental.py`, originally developed by (James Power)[https://github.com/jfpower/anfis-pytorch].
